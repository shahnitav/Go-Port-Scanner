<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Go Port Scanner is a lightweight and extremely fast port & host scanner.

`Host Discovery`

I decided to build this port scanner using Golang because of the concurrency provided by Go. I am using goroutines to check the status of multiple ports/hosts simulatenously. This leads to higher resource efficiency and speed to complete the scan. On an average Go Port Scanner was able to get the result in 50% less time compared to Nmap's fast scan. 

### Built With

* [Go](https://nextjs.org/)
* [argparse](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/akamensky/argparse)
* [color](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fatih/color)
* [ping](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sparrc/go-ping)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Instructions to set up this project in your local environment are listed down below.

### Prerequisites

* Go v1.18
  ```sh
  https://go.dev/doc/install
  ```
* Git
  ```
  https://git-scm.com/
  ```

## Installation

   Get the repository with go get
   ```sh
   go get github.com/shahnitav/Go-Port-Scanner
   ```

## Build
  To build the project
  1. Clone the repository
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/shahnitav/Go-Port-Scanner.git
      ```
  2. Run make
      ```sh
      make
      ```
      Or build the binary using 
      ```
      go build -o bin/ cmd/main.go
      ```

## Options
### `--ip [IP Address]`
Target IP Address/es whose Ports need to be scanned. It can parse single IP Address for Port Scanning as well as CIDR which can be used for Host Discovery.

For example:
```
--ip 192.168.126.131 || --ip 192.168.126.131
```
### `-p [Port Numbers]` `--port [Port Numbers]`
Specifies the ports to be scanned for to get their status. It can be a single value, a range of values, or multiple values. Port Numbers are required for Port Scanning and will not be considered during Host Discovery.

For example:
```
-p 80 || --port 1-9000 || -p 80,443,21
```
### `--t [Timeout]`
Used to configure the timeout in Milliseconds while connecting with a Port. Not required, the default value is 500ms.

### `-i` `--icmp`
It is a flag to be passed with a Single/CIDR IP Address to scan for hosts. ICMP Mode sends ICMP Ping packets to the hosts to check their status.

For example:
```
./main --ip 192.168.126.0/24 -i
```
### `-h` `--help`
Shows the Help page

## Usage

Go Port Scanner can be used to conduct follow tasks:

### **Scan for open port on a single host**
It will scan for open port 3306 on the host.
```
./main --ip 192.168.126.131 -p 3306
```

### **Scan for a range of open ports on a single host**
It will scan for open ports from 1-9000 and also label the common ports.
```
./main --ip 192.168.126.131 -p 1-9000
```

### **Scan for multiple open ports on a single host with a timeout of 1000ms**
It will scan for multiple open ports 80,443,1202 on the host.
```
./main --ip 192.168.126.131 -p 80,443,1202 -t 1000
```

### **Discover Hosts in the provided CIDR**
It will scan for open ports from 1-9000 and also label the common ports.
```
./main --ip 192.168.126.128/28 -i
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Parallel Port Scanning with Goroutines
- [x] Host discovery with ICMP Pings
- [ ] SYN Stealth Scanning
